## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-13

First preview. Windows is built and verified end to end; macOS and Linux are untested.

### Added

- Launches the [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) kernel
  (`@deepseek-ai/dsh` 0.1.0-rc.6) as a child process on a free loopback port and shows its
  web UI in a desktop window.
- Bundles the kernel and the Node runtime it is published against, so a packaged build has
  no external requirements. Both are pinned in `upstream.lock.json`; the kernel is checked
  against its npm integrity hash and Node against the SHA-256 published in that release's
  `SHASUMS256.txt`, with each artefact asked to confirm its own version afterwards.
- Waits for a real HTTP response from the launch being waited on before showing a window,
  and reports an unexpected kernel exit with its captured output rather than leaving a
  window pointed at a process that is gone.
- Confines the window to the kernel's exact origin, restricts external links to
  `http`/`https`, refuses `webview` attachment, and attaches no preload bridge.
- Gives the kernel a private `DSH_HOME`, drops inherited `DSH_*` variables, and sets
  telemetry to disabled explicitly.
- Captures kernel output into a bounded buffer, redacted on entry, with the count of
  dropped lines kept visible.
- `tools/scan-leaks.js`, run in CI, fails the build on credentials, private registries, or
  internal address ranges in the working tree or in history.

### Known limitations

- The kernel's native workspace picker crashes on Windows in this upstream preview.
  `buildShellPatch({ useBrowseDirectoryPicker: true })` selects the non-native
  implementation; it is not enabled by default yet.
- Log redaction matches by shape and cannot be complete.
- Installers are unsigned, so Windows SmartScreen will warn on first run.
